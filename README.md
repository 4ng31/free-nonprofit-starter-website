## A Free Website Template for Nonprofits
We're huge fans of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and wanted to help nonprofits take advantage of this powerful (and free!) tool. With about an hours worth of work you'll have a published website with the ability to accept online donations.

But most importantly, by hosting your site on Github you'll allow volunteers to easily contribute to ongoing development of your site.

#### Benefits 
**Open Source**  
Your site and its code will be hosted on Github. This makes it easy for any developer, designer, or copywriter to help customize your site.  
  
**Secure**   
Accepting online donations shouldn't be taken lightly. The template integrates third party services to handle any and all secure bits.  

**No Vendor Lock-In**  
The third party services we've chosen (for payments and email capture) allow you to transfer your data should you opt for an alternative solution down the road.

### Notes
1. This project requires getting your hands a little dirty. If you're looking for a more user-friendly service (albeit paid), we're big fans of [Squarespace](https://squarespace.com).
2. Be sure you understand the [risks of accepting online donations](https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/on-fraud-prevention/).  
3. If you're opting for a custom domain, be sure you understand the security implications. [This blog post](https://konklone.com/post/github-pages-now-supports-https-so-use-it) provides a good overview.
